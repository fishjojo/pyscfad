When using the jax backend to compute derivatives, the best practice
is to construct a function, where the inputs are variables and the outputs
are objectives (see e.g.,
the `jax document <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html#taking-derivatives-with-grad>`_).
In the following tutorials, we assume using the jax backend.

We present a few examples of using pyscfad. Most of them are included in paper `[1]`_.
